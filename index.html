  <br>
  <div style='border:red and black 5px dotted, 2px dashed; padding:10px; margin:10px'> While in this class, I learned about the names and functions of multiple enternal and external computer parts. I now have a more indepth understanding of the history of computers and the parts. I have been introduced to multiply websites, that will make my everyday life and possibly a job in the CNT field a lot more organized and easier. I now know binary code and the hexidecimal system. I can now convert back and forth between the two and the decimal system. All in all I feel like I now have a better understanding of what a computer is and how the parts work together.</div>
    <br>
    <p>Ch.1 History of the PC</p>
        <p>Computers are a very important part of todays world. Nearly every where you look there is some kind of computer.
        Eniac is believed to be the first computer used by the military in 1946. The first PC (Personal Computer) was introduced by IBM in 1981.
        The first computers were very large (ENIAC took up 1,800 square feet of floor space). Over the years there have been many great advances in computer tech.
        Now days you have a hand held computer/phone that fits into the palm of your hand.</p>
    <br>    
    <p>Ch.2 PC Component, Features and Design</p>
        <p>Who controlls PC software? Well, you would have to have lived in a cave all your life(with no web access) to not know it is Microsoft.
        The windows operating system pretty much dominates the market. Nearly all other programs run off of windows.
        In the early years of the PC, IBM hired Microsoft to design the software while they worked on the hardware.
        Since the first PC(in 1981), processor evolution has focused on 4 main features:Increasing the transistor count and density, Increasing the clock cycling speed, Increasing the size of internal registers(bits) and Increasing the number of cores in a single chip</p>
        Pentium and AMD(Advanced Micro Devices) have been at the lead on proceesors.</p>
     <br>   
     <p>Ch.3 CPU</p>
     	<p>The brain or engine of a computer is called Cental Processor Unit or Microprocessor. Intel is credited for creating the first one. One can cost up to 4 times that of the motherboard and is one of the 2 most expensive parts for a computer.
     	Originally Intel made memory chips not processors. The 8080 CPU started the PC revolution. The Z80 was released July, 1976 and is still in use today, in scientific and graphing calculators.
     	In 30 years of processing, speeds have increased more then 18,500 times (.108Mhz to 2+Ghz).</p>
     <br>
     <p>CH.4 Motherboards</P>
     	<p>Without a doubt this is the most important part of a computer. Nearly all other internal parts are connected to it. Some other names for motherboard are: main board, system board, and planer.
     	There are several form factors for a mother board. Form Factor is the physical dimentions or size and shape, as well as connectors, and screw holes.
     	Some form factors are: (obsolete)Baby-AT, Full-size AT, LPX, NLX, WTX, BTX, micro BTX, and picoBTX. (modern) ATX, microATX, flexATX, DTX/Mini-DTX, and ITX/Mini-ITX.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Ch.5 BIOS</p>
     	<p>There are three possible sources for BIOS in a running pc. They are: Motherboard ROM, adapter card ROMs (such as video cards),Loaded into RAM from disk (divice drivers).
     	ROM = Read-only-memory. Can permanently or semi permanently hold data, is extremely difficult or imposible to write to.
     	POST = Tests your computer's processor, memory, chipset, video adapter, disk-controller, disk drivers, keyboard and other crucial components.
     	BIOS has 4 main functions: POST, Set-up, Bootstrap loader, and BIOS.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.6 Memory</p>
     	<p>There are four main chip types. They are:ROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM.</P>
     	<p>ROM-Read only memory</p>
     	<p>PROM-Programmable Memory</p>
     	<p>EPROM-Erasable PROM</p>
     	<p>EEPROM-Electrically erasable PROM, also called Flash ROM.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Ch.7 ATA/IDE Interfaces</p>
     	<p>ATA and IDE are an iterface standard for connecting storage devices of a computer, such as optical drive, hard drive, and floppy drive.
     	In 2003 Serial ATA was introduced and the original ATA was then known as Parallel ATA.
     	Serial ATA enabled the use of smaller cables and provided higher performance due to the higher cycling speeds.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.8 Magnetic Storage</p>
     	<p>Most permanent or semipermenant computer data is stored magnetically, meaning bionary code is stored by magnetizing tiny bits of metal embedded in the surface of a disk or tape in a pattern that resembles the data.
     	Before magnetic storage all there was was punch cards.
     	IBM engineers and scientists back in June of 1949 started work on the new form of storage.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.9 Hard Disk Stoage</p>
     	<p>Hard Disk Storage is one of the most important and mysterious parts of a computer. HDDs are sealed units used for nonvolatile or semipermanent storage.
     	This means data that is retained even when the power is off. if this part fails then there is usually no recovering the computer.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.10 Removable Storage</p>
     	<p>Since the 1980s the primary storage for a computer has been the hard disk drive. More recently there have been more options for storage. They are mostly used for data backup, data tranfer(between computers), and teporary storage.
     	Some of these options are: flash memory devices/drives, optical drives, magnetic tape drives, removable media hard drives, and even floppy drives. Cloud storage is very popular now days.
     	Several types of flash memory are: Compact Flash, SmartMedia, MultiMediaCard, SecureDigital, Memory Stick, ATA Flash, xD-Picture Card, Solid-state drive, and USB flash devices.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Ch.11 Optical Storage</p>
     	<p>There are three types of disk storage for computers: Magnetic, Flash memory, and optical. With magnetic data is stored magnetically on a rotating disk.
     	Flash memory stores information in special cells that can be written, erased, and rewritten, yet still retain information when power is turned off.
     	Optical storage is simular to magnetic in its basic operation. It uses light(optically) instead of magnetics. Many optical storage media is either read-only or write-once.
     	At one time it was thought that optical storage would replace magnetic, but it has proven to be slower and far less dense. Optical storage is mainly used as a backup.
     	As digital downloads become more common place, flash memory will more then likely replace magnetic.</p>

     <p>Ch.12 GPU</p>
     	<p>Gpu also known as Graphics Processing Unit, The Video Processor, Video Chipset, and Video Graphics Processor.
     	Before you a system or video card, you need to find out the chipset it will use. This will allow you to have the following: A better comparison of the card or system to others, access to technical specifications, access to reviews and options, the ability to make a better buying decision, the choice of card manufacturer or chipset manufacturersupport, and drivers.
     	NVIDIA and AMD are both componies that produce GPUs.Two cards that use the same chipsets can still have different features, and can differ in actual performance.
     	GPU-Z is a freeware utility that you can use to get detailed info about your GPU. Some details you can get are: Name, build technology, bus interface, Direct X support, RAM size, component temp, BIOS version, driver version, rendering support, number of shaders, pixels and texture fill rate, over clock speeds and more.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.13 Audio Hardware</p>
     	<p>Early computers used audio as a troubleshooting method, rather then for creative tasks. Some of the first computers only audio was crude tones or beeps.
     	It was not until the late 1980's that computers had the first add-on sound card.
     	We have gone from expensive and exotic add-ons to an industrial standard. Sound card can be added using the PCI component.
     	The quality of the audio hardware is measured by three criteria: Frequency responds(range), total harmonic distortion, and signal-to-noise ratio.
     	Frequncy responds is the range that adio systems can play or record at a consistant and audible amplitute level. Many card support 30Mhz-20Ghz. The wider the sread the better.
     	Total Hermonic Distortion is the measure of accurate sound reproduction. The smaller the percentage of distortion, the better.
     	Signal-to-noise ratio measures the strength of the sound signal relitive to background noise. The higher the number(measured in decibels) the better the sound quality.
     	Sampling is the process of turning the original analog sound into digital(binary) signals that a computer can use. In the beginning sampling used 8-bit digital sampling but today uses 32-bit or larger. This makes for better sampling.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.14 External I/O Interfaces</p>
     	<p>Also known as the external peripheral input/output ports. For a very long time that was serial and parallel ports but now include USB(universal serial bus), FireWire, Thunderbolt Technology interfaces.
     	External input/output ports can be divided into two variants. High-speed and low-speed. serial and parallel are slow, while USB and FireWire are fast. FireWire is being replaced by Thunderbolt.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>Ch.15 Input Devices</p>
     	<p>The primary input divice is the keyboard. You use the keyboard to input data and commands. IBM created three designs for the PC and Microsoft augmented one of them. These have become the standard for all keyboards. The primary keyboard types are: 101-key Enhanced keyboard, 103/104-key Windows keyboard, 83-key PC and XT keyboard(obsolete), and the 84-key AT keyboard.
     	The 101-key Enhanced keyboard was introduced in1986 by IBM and is still in use.</p>
     <br>	
     <p>CH.17 Local Area Networking</p><p>
     	<p>A network is a group of two or more computers that intelligently share hardware or software devices with each other. A net work can be as simple as two computers sharing a printer or as vast as the internet.
     	Most home or small-business networks share a printer and the internet.
     	You can share or access many devices in a network, such as: printers(including multifunctional devices), storage devices, modems, cameras, mediaplayers/recorders, tablets, smartphones, and game consoles.
     	There are several types of networks: Personal Area Network(PAN), Local Area Network(LAN), Metropolitan(MAN), Wide Area Networks(WAN), Wireless Wide Area Networks(WWANs), The Internet, Intranet, and Extranets.</p>
     <br>

     <br>
     <p>Ch.18 Power Supply</p>
     	<p>One of if not the most important component in a computer. Without it you can not have a computer. If your power supply malfunctions then there is a good chance other components in your computer are destroyed.
     	The main function and operation of the power supply is to convert power supplied by the wall outlet to what the computer can use.
     	The power supply converts the 120v or 240v AC to +3.3v, +5v, and +12v DC.
     	Voltage used in a computer are called voltage rails. There are three: +3.3v, +5v and +12v.
     	The +3.3v rail powers the following devices: chipsets, some dual inline modules, peripheral compnent interconnect, accelerated graphics port, PCI express cards and misc chips.
     	The +5v rail powers Disk drive logic, low-voltage motor, single inline memory modules, PCI, AGP, ISA cards voltage regulators and misc. chips.
     	The +12v rail powers motors, high-output voltage regulators, AGP, and PCIe cards.</p>
