  <h1 id='moveit'>Computers for Beginners Notes</h1>
    <p>Ch.1 History of the PC</p>
        Computers are a very important part of todays world. Nearly every where you look there is some kind of computer.
        Eniac is believed to be the first computer used by the military in 1946. The first PC (Personal Computer) was introduced by IBM in 1981.
        The first computers were very large (ENIAC took up 1,800 square feet of floor space). Over the years there have been many great advances in computer tech.
        Now days you have a hand held computer/phone that fits into the palm of your hand.
        
    <p>Ch.2 PC Component, Features and Design</p>
        Who controlls PC software? Well, you would have to have lived in a cave all your life(with no web access) to not know it is Microsoft.
        The windows operating system pretty much dominates the market. Nearly all other programs run off of windows.
        In the early years of the PC, IBM hired Microsoft to design the software while they worked on the hardware.
        Since the first PC(in 1981), processor evolution has focused on 4 main features:
          Increasing the transistor count and density
          Increasing the clock cycling speed
          Increasing the size of internal registers(bits)
          Increasing the number of cores in a single chip
        Pentium and AMD(Advanced Micro Devices) have been at the lead on proceesors.
        
     <p>Ch.5 BIOS</p>
     	There are three possible sources for BIOS in a running pc. They are: Motherboard ROM, adapter card ROMs (such as video cards),Loaded into RAM from disk (divice drivers).
     	ROM = Read-only-memory. Can permanently or semi permanently hold data, is extremely difficult or imposible to write to.
     	POST = Tests your computer's processor, memory, chipset, video adapter, disk-controller, disk drivers, keyboard and other crucial components.
     	BIOS has 4 main functions: POST, Set-up, Bootstrap loader, and BIOS.
     	
     	There are four main chip types. They are:ROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM.
     	ROM-Read only memory
     	PROM-Programmable Memory
     	EPROM-Erasable PROM
     	EEPROM-Electrically erasable PROM, also called Flash ROM.
