  <h1 id='moveit'>Computers for Beginners Notes</h1>
    <p>Ch.1 History of the PC</p>
        Computers are a very important part of todays world. Nearly every where you look there is some kind of computer.
        Eniac is believed to be the first computer used by the military in 1946. The first PC (Personal Computer) was introduced by IBM in 1981.
        The first computers were very large (ENIAC took up 1,800 square feet of floor space). Over the years there have been many great advances in computer tech.
        Now days you have a hand held computer/phone that fits into the palm of your hand.
        
    <p>Ch.2 PC Component, Features and Design</p>
        Who controlls PC software? Well, you would have to have lived in a cave all your life(with no web access) to not know it is Microsoft.
        The windows operating system pretty much dominates the market. Nearly all other programs run off of windows.
        In the early years of the PC, IBM hired Microsoft to design the software while they worked on the hardware.
        Since the first PC(in 1981), processor evolution has focused on 4 main features:Increasing the transistor count and density, Increasing the clock cycling speed, Increasing the size of internal registers(bits) and Increasing the number of cores in a single chip</p>
        Pentium and AMD(Advanced Micro Devices) have been at the lead on proceesors.
        
     <p>Ch.3 CPU</p>
     	The brain or engine of a computer is called Cental Processor Unit or Microprocessor. Intel is credited for creating the first one. One can cost up to 4 times that of the motherboard and is one of the 2 most expensive parts for a computer.
     	Originally Intel made memory chips not processors. The 8080 CPU started the PC revolution. The Z80 was released July, 1976 and is still in use today, in scientific and graphing calculators.
     	In 30 years of processing, speeds have increased more then 18,500 times (.108Mhz to 2+Ghz).
     
     <p>CH.4 Motherboards</P>
     	Without a doubt this is the most important part of a computer. Nearly all other internal parts are connected to it. Some other names for motherboard are: main board, system board, and planer.
     	There are several form factors for a mother board. Form Factor is the physical dimentions or size and shape, as well as connectors, and screw holes.
     	Some form factors are: (obsolete)Baby-AT, Full-size AT, LPX, NLX, WTX, BTX, micro BTX, and picoBTX. (modern) ATX, microATX, flexATX, DTX/Mini-DTX, and ITX/Mini-ITX.
     
     <p>Ch.5 BIOS</p>
     	There are three possible sources for BIOS in a running pc. They are: Motherboard ROM, adapter card ROMs (such as video cards),Loaded into RAM from disk (divice drivers).
     	ROM = Read-only-memory. Can permanently or semi permanently hold data, is extremely difficult or imposible to write to.
     	POST = Tests your computer's processor, memory, chipset, video adapter, disk-controller, disk drivers, keyboard and other crucial components.
     	BIOS has 4 main functions: POST, Set-up, Bootstrap loader, and BIOS.
     	
     <p>Ch.6 Memory</p>
     	There are four main chip types. They are:ROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM.
     	ROM-Read only memory
     	PROM-Programmable Memory
     	EPROM-Erasable PROM
     	EEPROM-Electrically erasable PROM, also called Flash ROM.
     
     <p>Ch.7 ATA/IDE Interfaces</p>
     	ATA and IDE are an iterface standard for connecting storage devices of a computer, such as optical drive, hard drive, and floppy drive.
     	In 2003 Serial ATA was introduced and the original ATA was then known as Parallel ATA.
     	Serial ATA enabled the use of smaller cables and provided higher performance due to the higher cycling speeds.
     	
     <p>Ch. 8 Magnetic Storage</p>
     	Most permanent or semipermenant computer data is stored magnetically, meaning bionary code is stored by magnetizing tiny bits of metal embedded in the surface of a disk or tape in a pattern that resembles the data.
     	Before magnetic storage all there was was punch cards.
     	IBM engineers and scientists back in June of 1949 started work on the new form of storage.
     	
     <p>Ch. 9 Hard Disk Stoage</p>
     	Hard Disk Storage is one of the most important and mysterious parts of a computer. HDDs are sealed units used for nonvolatile or semipermanent storage.
     	This means data that is retained even when the power is off. if this part fails then there is usually no recovering the computer.
     	
     <p>Ch. 10 Removable Storage</p>
     	Since the 1980s the primary storage for a computer has been the hard disk drive. More recently there have been more options for storage. They are mostly used for data backup, data tranfer(between computers), and teporary storage.
     	Some of these options are: flash memory devices/drives, optical drives, magnetic tape drives, removable media hard drives, and even floppy drives. Cloud storage is very popular now days.
     	Several types of flash memory are: Compact Flash, SmartMedia, MultiMediaCard,
